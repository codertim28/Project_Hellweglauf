# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because I would like to involve volunteer developers to help this project get ahead.

## Submitting Changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to me with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow the coding conventions (below)
and make sure all of your commits contain one feature (-> one feature per commit).

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
## Coding conventions
- I indent using two tabs
- I pursue the idea of the strong view (so you can put logic into the view)
- I **always** put spaces after list items and method parameters 
(`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and so on.

Please read my code, before you contribute.


Thanks,<br/>
Tim
